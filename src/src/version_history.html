<br>

If you're seeing these release notes, it means that you just upgraded to the
latest and greatest version of Quadrilateral, version 2.0.0.

<h2>Version History</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2.0.0</li> Renamed all the commands for easier maintainence down the
road. This is a breaking change for upgrades, so, semantic versioning suggests
that it's a major number bump. Also added the upgrade flow.
  <li>1.0.2</li> Fixed some typos
  <li>1.0.1</li> Made the onboarding documentation accessible post-onboarding.
This wasn't released to the Chrome Web Store because it was quickly superceded
by 1.0.2.
  <li>1.0.0</li> Added onboarding flow and default commands
  <li>0.0.8</li> Initial release to the Chrome Web Store
</ul>
