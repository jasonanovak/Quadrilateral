<h1>What is Quadrilateral</h1><p>
Quadrilateral is a keyboard based window organizer for ChromeOS.<p>
You can use Quadrilateral to assign a keyboard shorcut to resize a ChromeOS
window to 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 of the screen and move the resized window to a
fixed position (e.g. the top left 1/6th or right 1/3rd of the screen).
<br>
<h1>How to Use Quadrilateral</h1><p>
You need to go  <a href="#" id="extensionsShortcutLink">Chrome Settings >
Extensions > Keyboard shortcuts</a>
to configure keyboard shortcuts. There are three configured by default:
<ul>
    <li>Ctrl+Shift+4 - Resizes and moves the window to the left third of the screen.</li>
    <li>Ctrl+Shift+5 - Resizes and moves the window to the center third of the screen.</li>
    <li>Ctrl+Shift+6 - Resizes and moves the window to the right third of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
After you configure Quadrilateral's shortcuts, you can then use those shortcuts
to quickly resize and move the active ChromeOS window.
<br>
<h1>FAQs</h1>
<h2>Why aren't more shortcuts pre-configured?</h2>
The <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/commands">Chrome commands API</a>
only allows for four shortcuts to be configured by default.
<br>
<h2>How do does the author of Quadrilateral have it configured?</h2>
Here's the author's configuration:
<ul>
  <li>Thirds 01 (Left 1/3rd): Ctrl + Shift + 4</li>
  <li>Thirds 02 (Center 1/3rd): Ctrl + Shift + 5</li>
  <li>Thirds 03 (Right 1/3rd: Ctrl + Shift + 6</li>
  <li>Sixths 01 (Top Left 1/6th): Ctrl + Shift + 1</li>
  <li>Sixths 02 (Top Center 1/6th): Ctrl + Shift + 2</li>
  <li>Sixths 03 (Top Right 1/6th): Ctrl + Shift + 3</li>
  <li>Sixths 04 (Bottom Left 1/6th): Ctrl + Shift + 7</li>
  <li>Sixths 05 (Bottom Center 1/6th): Ctrl + Shift + 8</li>
  <li>Sixths 06 (Bottom Right 1/6th): Ctrl + Shift + 9</li>
  <li>Quarters 01 (Top Right 1/4th): Alt + Home </li>
  <li>Quarters 02 (Top Left 1/4th): Alt + Page Up</li>
  <li>Quarters 03 (Bottom Left 1/4th): Alt + Page Down</li>
  <li>Quarters 04 (Bottom Right 1/4th): Alt + end</li>
  <li>Halves 01 (Top 1/2th): I don't have this configured as I don't split
windows this way.</li>
  <li>Halves 02 (Bottom 1/2th): I don't have this configured as I don't split
windows this way.</li>
  <li>Halves 03 (Left 1/2th): Alt + Shift + D</li>
  <li>Halves 04 (Right 1/2th): Alt + Shift + G</li>
</ul>
The author chose these shortcuts as they didn't collide with anything in
ChromeOS. Some of these are not ergonomic -- they were designed for use with a
programmable keyboard (e.g. a <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander">ZSA Moonlander</a>
) where <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/XYVAx/latest/0">
keys can be programmed with macros to send these shortcuts when those keys are
held</a>.
<br>
<h2>Why does Quadrilateral have Halves 03 and 04 when ChromeOS supports
these window resize actions natively?</h2>
Because ChromeOS has an animation associated with it that is slower than Quadrilateral's resize and move.
<br>
<h2>I am using macOS or Windows or Linux, can I use this extension?</h2>
You can, but, it'll only work for Chrome windows (and on ChromeOS most windows are a Chrome window).<p>
If you're on Linux, your desktop environment probably has some equivalent functionality or add-ons
(e.g. <a href="https://github.com/lucmos/UltrawideWindows">UltrawideWindows for KDE)</a>.<p>
If you're on macOS, <a href="https://rectangleapp.com/">Rectangle.app</a> provides similar functionality.
I'm not familiar enough with Windows to say what the equivalent would be.
