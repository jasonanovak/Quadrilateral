Welcome to Quadrilateral!<p>
Quadrilateral is a keyboard based window organizer for ChromeOS.<p>
You can use Quadrilateral to assign a keyboard shorcut to resize a ChromeOS window to 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 of the screen 
and move the resized window to a fixed position (e.g. the top left 1/6th or right 1/3rd of the screen).<p>
<p>
You need to go  <a href="#" id="extensionsShortcutLink">Chrome Settings > Extensions > Keyboard shortcuts</a>
to configure keyboard shortcuts. There are three configured by default:
<ul>
    <li>Ctrl+Shift+4 - Resizes and moves the window to the left third of the screen.</li>
    <li>Ctrl+Shift+5 - Resizes and moves the window to the center third of the screen.</li>
    <li>Ctrl+Shift+6 - Resizes and moves the window to the right third of the screen.</li>
</ul>
